# Horiseon-website
## Description
My motivation was to enhance the existing Horiseon marketing website to ensure all the links were functioning correctly, and that the website would be deployed at live URL without any errors.

I wanted to build this project to improve my skills in coding as a web developer. The project involved a variety of tasks including updating the HTML and CSS coding to meet best practices, updating the CSS coding to follow semantic structure, adding commenting, finding errors, and using the GitHub Repository.

My goals of the project were completed, and I was able to ensure the website loaded effectively, updating the coding on the CSS and HTML, and produced the links using GitHub.

The project provided a fantastic learning opportunity as I had to do a lot of independent research to achieve the desired outcomes. Also, I was able to collaborate with another developer who provided advice on how I can improve the coding further.

All in all, the refactoring of the Horiseon marketing website was a unique project allowing me to apply my skills as a web developer in research, problem-solving, and coding. I was able to achieve the desired outcomes of my project successfully and have come out as a more adept developer in the process.
